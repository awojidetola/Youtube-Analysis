# Youtube Data Analysis
In this project, the top 200 youtube channels (based on the number of subscribers) were analyzed in terms of their number of subscribers, total views and likes, engagement rate and their video content. 
Based on the analysis, it was inferred that there is a strong positive correlation (0.83) between number of subscribers and total number of views of the Youtube Channels. Also, most of the top youtubers are resident in USA or India.
